**Dataset Name**: AV : Healthcare Analytics

**Overview**: This dataset contains data related to health camps organized by MedCamp over a period of 4 years. The data includes information on registration, patient profiles, and attendance details for different formats of health camps. The goal is to predict the probability of a favorable outcome, such as obtaining a health score or visiting a stall. The dataset is divided into multiple files, each capturing different aspects of the health camps and patient interactions. The columns in the dataset include: ['Health_Camp_Id', 'Camp_Start_Date', 'Camp_End_Date', 'Category', 'Patient_ID', 'Registration_Date', 'Online_Follower', 'Social_media', 'Income', 'Education', 'Age', 'First_Interaction_Date', 'City_Type', 'Employer_Category', 'Donation', 'Health_Score', 'Number_of_stall_visited', 'Last_Stall_Visited_Number']. Below is a sample of the data to provide insight into the typical content and structure of the dataset:

Health_Camp_Id, Camp_Start_Date, Camp_End_Date, Category, Patient_ID, Registration_Date, Online_Follower, Social_media, Income, Education, Age, First_Interaction_Date, City_Type, Employer_Category, Donation, Health_Score, Number_of_stall_visited, Last_Stall_Visited_Number
