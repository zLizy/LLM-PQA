Dataset Name: seattle-weather

Overview:
This dataset provides comprehensive weather data for Seattle, capturing daily observations on precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, wind speeds, and general weather conditions (drizzle, rain, sun, snow, fog). It's aimed at supporting predictive models to forecast weather conditions, thereby serving as a foundational dataset for climate research, weather prediction modeling, and educational purposes related to meteorology.

Usage:
The Seattle Weather dataset is employed extensively in predictive analytics projects focused on weather and climate modeling. It's particularly useful for developing machine learning models to predict weather patterns, understand climate change impacts, and for educational scenarios that require a hands-on approach to learning about weather data analysis.
