- Dataset Name: processed_Churn_Modelling

- Overview: The dataset 'processed_Churn_Modelling' contains information related to bank customers and their interaction with the bank. It includes columns such as 'RowNumber', 'CustomerId', 'CreditScore', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'NumOfProducts', 'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Exited', 'Geography_France', 'Geography_Germany', 'Geography_Spain', 'Geography_nan', 'Gender_Female', and 'Gender_Male'. The dataset provides insights into customer attributes and behavior that can be used for building predictive models related to churn prediction.

- Size: The dataset contains a significant number of records with numerous columns, making it suitable for building robust predictive models. The size of the dataset may vary depending on the specific use case.

- Typical Use Case: The dataset is commonly used for predictive modeling tasks, specifically in the area of churn prediction. By analyzing the various customer attributes provided in the dataset, organizations can identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn. This information can then be used to develop strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

- Relevant Columns:
    1. CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer.
    2. CreditScore: The credit score of the customer.
    3. Age: The age of the customer.
    4. Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
    5. Balance: The account balance of the customer.
    6. NumOfProducts: Number of bank products the customer uses.
    7. HasCrCard: Binary indicator for whether the customer has a credit card.
    8. IsActiveMember: Binary indicator for whether the customer is an active member.
    9. EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer.
    10. Exited: Binary indicator for whether the customer has churned.
    11. Geography_France: Binary indicator for whether the customer is from France.
    12. Geography_Germany: Binary indicator for whether the customer is from Germany.
    13. Geography_Spain: Binary indicator for whether the customer is from Spain.
    14. Geography_nan: Binary indicator for missing geography data.
    15. Gender_Female: Binary indicator for female gender.
    16. Gender_Male: Binary indicator for male gender.
