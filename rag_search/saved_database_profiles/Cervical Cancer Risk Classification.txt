Dataset Name: Cervical Cancer Risk Classification

Overview: This dataset contains data related to various risk factors for cervical cancer, which are used to predict cancer indicators and determine the need for biopsy examination. The dataset includes the following columns: ['Age', 'Number of sexual partners', 'First sexual intercourse', 'Num of pregnancies', 'Smokes', 'Smokes (years)', 'Smokes (packs/year)', 'Hormonal Contraceptives', 'Hormonal Contraceptives (years)', 'IUD']. Below is a sample of the data to provide insight into the typical content and structure of the dataset:

Age, Number of sexual partners, First sexual intercourse, Num of pregnancies, Smokes, Smokes (years), Smokes (packs/year), Hormonal Contraceptives, Hormonal Contraceptives (years), IUD
34, 3.0, 21.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 15.0, 0.0
42, 3.0, 23.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
51, 3.0, 17.0, 6.0, 1.0, 34.0, 3.4, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0
26, 1.0, 26.0, 3.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0
45, 1.0, 20.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0

Usage: This dataset is extensively used in medical research and predictive analytics projects focused on cervical cancer. It is particularly useful for developing machine learning models to predict the likelihood of cervical cancer based on various demographic, behavioral, and medical factors. This dataset supports a wide range of healthcare analyses, from understanding risk determinants to developing prevention and early intervention strategies.

The Cervical Cancer Risk Classification dataset is essential for academic research and clinical applications. It aids healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals, optimizing screening protocols, and improving patient outcomes through targeted preventive measures.
