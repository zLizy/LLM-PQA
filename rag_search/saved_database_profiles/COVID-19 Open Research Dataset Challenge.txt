### Dataset Name
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)

### Overview
The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a resource of over 1,000,000 scholarly articles, including over 400,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This dataset has been prepared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by a coalition of leading research groups to aid the global research community in applying AI and data mining techniques to generate new insights and support ongoing efforts to combat the disease.

### Sample Data
Due to the large size and complexity of the dataset, here's an example of the kind of data you might find in one of the articles:

| Title                                     | Authors                     | Abstract                                                                                         | Published Year | Journal                 | Full Text Available |
