Dataset Name: insurance

Overview: The insurance dataset contains various columns including 'age', 'bmi', 'children', 'charges', 'sex_female', 'sex_male', 'smoker_no', 'smoker_yes', 'region_northeast', 'region_northwest', 'region_southeast', and 'region_southwest'. It includes information on individuals such as their age, body mass index (BMI), number of children, insurance charges, gender, smoking habits, and region.

Number of Instances: The dataset consists of a specific number of rows/instances, where each row represents an individual's information.

Number of Attributes: There are 12 attributes/columns in the dataset.
