Model Overview
The Vision Transformer (ViT), pre-trained on ImageNet-21k and fine-tuned on ImageNet 2012, introduces a BERT-like architecture to image classification tasks. By treating images as sequences of patches, ViT applies the Transformer encoder's capability to learn internal representations, enabling it to perform image classification effectively.

Intended Use
This model is primarily intended for image classification tasks. It can classify images into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes, making it suitable for a wide range of image recognition applications.

Technical Details
Algorithm Type: Transformer Encoder (BERT-like)
Input Features: Images as sequences of 16x16 patches, with a resolution of 224x224 pixels
Output: Classification into one of 1,000 ImageNet classes
Pre-training Data: ImageNet-21k dataset, 14 million images across 21,843 classes
Fine-tuning Data: ImageNet (ILSVRC2012), 1 million images across 1,000 classes
Model Performance
The model has demonstrated significant effectiveness in image classification benchmarks, with best results obtained at a higher resolution (384x384). Model size increment leads to improved performance.

Limitations
The model's performance is closely tied to the characteristics and quality of the training data. It is primarily designed for image classification; its effectiveness in other vision tasks might vary.
