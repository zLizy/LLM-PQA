### Model Name: Energy Consumption Estimator

### Dataset Name: Household Energy Usage Data

### Model Overview:
The Energy Consumption Estimator model is a linear regression model designed to predict household energy consumption based on various factors. It utilizes input features such as household size, number of electrical appliances, insulation quality, local climate, and occupancy patterns to estimate the monthly energy consumption of a household.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by energy companies, homeowners, and policymakers to manage and optimize energy usage. It helps in forecasting energy demands, planning energy distribution, and implementing energy-saving measures based on historical usage patterns.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Linear Regression
- Input Features: ['household_size', 'number_of_appliances', 'insulation_quality', 'local_climate', 'occupancy_patterns']
- Output: Predicted monthly energy consumption (kWh)

### Model Performance:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 150.34
- RÂ² Score: 0.79

### Limitations:
- The model assumes a linear relationship between input variables and energy consumption, which may not account for non-linear usage patterns and interactions.
- The model's accuracy is dependent on the quality and granularity of the input data. Incomplete or coarse data can lead to inaccurate predictions.
- Seasonal variations and sudden changes in occupancy or appliance usage are not explicitly modeled, which can affect prediction reliability.
