### Model Name: Restaurant Recommendation Neural Network

### Dataset Name: Yelp Review Data

### Model Overview:
The Restaurant Recommendation Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to recommend restaurants to users based on their dining history and review patterns. It uses a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, leveraging a neural network architecture to predict user preferences for restaurants.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by food delivery services, restaurant review platforms, and dining apps to enhance user experience by providing personalized restaurant recommendations. It helps users discover restaurants they are likely to enjoy based on their dining preferences and past reviews.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Neural Network
- Input Features: User ID, Restaurant ID, User review history, Restaurant metadata (cuisine type, location, price range)
- Output: Predicted user rating for a restaurant

### Model Performance:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.63
- Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE): 0.70

### Limitations:
- The model requires a substantial amount of user interaction data to generate accurate recommendations.
- It may not perform well with sparse data or new restaurants that lack sufficient review data.
- The model's effectiveness depends on the quality and completeness of the input data.
