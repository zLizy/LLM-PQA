### Model Name: Book Recommendation Neural Network

### Dataset Name: Goodreads Reviews

### Model Overview:
The Book Recommendation Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to recommend books to users based on their reading history and reviews. It combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques using a neural network architecture to predict user ratings for books.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by online bookstores, library systems, and reading platforms to enhance user experience by providing personalized book recommendations. It helps users discover books they are likely to enjoy based on their past reads and preferences.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Neural Network
- Input Features: User ID, Book ID, User rating history, Book metadata (genre, author, publication year)
- Output: Predicted user rating for a book

### Model Performance:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.72
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.85

### Limitations:
- The model requires extensive user interaction data to provide accurate recommendations.
- Cold start problem: New users or books with no interaction data may not receive accurate recommendations initially.
- The model's performance can be influenced by the diversity and representativeness of the training data.
