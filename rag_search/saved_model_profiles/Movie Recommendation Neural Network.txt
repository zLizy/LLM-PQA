### Model Name: Movie Recommendation Neural Network

### Dataset Name: MovieLens Dataset

### Model Overview:
The Movie Recommendation Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to recommend movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences. It employs collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques using a neural network architecture to predict user ratings for movies.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by streaming platforms, movie recommendation services, and entertainment companies to enhance user experience by providing personalized movie recommendations. It helps users discover movies they are likely to enjoy based on their past interactions and preferences.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Neural Network
- Input Features: User ID, Movie ID, User rating history, Movie metadata (genre, director, cast)
- Output: Predicted user rating for a movie

### Model Performance:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.68
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.82

### Limitations:
- The model requires a significant amount of user interaction data to provide accurate recommendations.
- Cold start problem: New users or movies with no interaction data may not receive accurate recommendations initially.
- The model's performance can be influenced by the diversity and representativeness of the training data.
