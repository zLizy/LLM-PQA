### Model Name: Travel Destination Recommendation Neural Network

### Dataset Name: TripAdvisor Travel Data

### Model Overview:
The Travel Destination Recommendation Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to recommend travel destinations to users based on their travel history and preferences. It utilizes a neural network architecture to combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, predicting user interests in various travel destinations.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by travel agencies, tourism platforms, and vacation planning apps to enhance user experience by providing personalized travel destination recommendations. It helps users discover travel spots they are likely to enjoy based on their past trips and preferences.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Neural Network
- Input Features: User ID, Destination ID, User travel history, Destination metadata (location, attractions, price range)
- Output: Predicted user interest in a travel destination

### Model Performance:
- Precision@K: 0.78
- Recall@K: 0.75

### Limitations:
- The model requires extensive user interaction data to provide accurate recommendations.
- Cold start problem: New users or destinations with no interaction data may not receive accurate recommendations initially.
- The model's performance can be influenced by the diversity and representativeness of the training data.
