### Model Name: Student Performance Predictor

### Dataset Name: High School Performance Data

### Model Overview:
The Student Performance Predictor is a linear regression model designed to forecast students' final grades based on various academic and personal factors. It uses features such as study time, previous grades, attendance, participation in extracurricular activities, and parental education level to predict the final grade of students.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by educators, school administrators, and policymakers to identify students at risk of underperforming and to implement targeted interventions. It assists in educational planning and resource allocation by providing insights into factors that influence student performance.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Linear Regression
- Input Features: ['study_time', 'previous_grades', 'attendance', 'extracurricular_activities', 'parental_education_level']
- Output: Predicted final grade

### Model Performance:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 12.56
- RÂ² Score: 0.76

### Limitations:
- The model assumes a linear relationship between input variables and student performance, which may not fully capture complex educational dynamics.
- External factors such as socio-economic status, psychological well-being, and classroom environment are not included in the model, which can affect its accuracy.
- The model's predictions are only as good as the input data, and any bias in the data can lead to biased predictions.
