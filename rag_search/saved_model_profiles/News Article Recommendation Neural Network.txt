### Model Name: News Article Recommendation Neural Network

### Dataset Name: News Portal Interaction Data

### Model Overview:
The News Article Recommendation Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to recommend news articles to users based on their reading history and interaction patterns. It utilizes a neural network architecture that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to predict user preferences for news articles.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by news websites, news aggregator apps, and digital magazines to enhance user experience by providing personalized news recommendations. It helps users discover news articles they are likely to find interesting based on their past reading habits and interaction patterns.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Neural Network
- Input Features: User ID, Article ID, User reading history, Article metadata (category, author, publication date)
- Output: Predicted user preference for a news article

### Model Performance:
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): 0.65
- F1 Score: 0.72

### Limitations:
- The model requires a large volume of user interaction data to generate accurate recommendations.
- Cold start problem: New users or articles with no interaction data may not receive accurate recommendations initially.
- The model's performance depends on the quality and variety of the input data.
