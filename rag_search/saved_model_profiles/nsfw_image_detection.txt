Model Overview
The Fine-Tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) is adapted from the original transformer architecture for image classification. This model, named "google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k," undergoes pre-training on the ImageNet-21k dataset, with images resized to 224x224 pixels. It's specifically fine-tuned for NSFW (Not Safe for Work) image classification, utilizing a proprietary dataset of 80,000 images categorized into "normal" and "nsfw" to accurately identify explicit content.

Intended Use
This model is primarily designed for NSFW image classification, assisting in filtering explicit content across various digital platforms. It's a critical tool for enhancing content safety and moderation.

Technical Details
Algorithm Type: Transformer Encoder Architecture
