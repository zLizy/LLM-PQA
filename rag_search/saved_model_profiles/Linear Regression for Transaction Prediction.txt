Model Overview
Linear regression, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm, predicts a continuous target variable from one or more independent variables, assuming a linear relationship.

Intended Use
Applied in financial analytics to predict future transaction amounts based on historical data.

Technical Details
Algorithm Type: Supervised Learning
Input Features: Independent variables
Output: Continuous target variable
Training: Best-fitting line or hyperplane that minimizes prediction errors.
Model Performance
Efficient in predicting transaction amounts, aiding in financial planning and analysis.

Limitations
Assumes linear relationships, which may not apply in all financial datasets.
