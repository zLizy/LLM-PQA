Model Overview
The Gaussian Naive Bayes model is a probabilistic classifier designed for predicting weather conditions based on weather-related measurements.

Intended Use
Ideal for meteorologists and weather forecasting applications, providing accurate and quick predictions of weather conditions.

Technical Details
Algorithm Type: Probabilistic Classifier
Input Features: Precipitation, temperature ranges, wind speed
Output: Weather condition
Training: Historical weather records dataset.
Model Performance
Reliable in various weather condition predictions, useful in outdoor planning and agricultural decisions.

Limitations
Assumes feature independence, which may not always hold true in real-world data.
