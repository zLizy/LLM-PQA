### Model Name: Crop Yield Predictor

### Dataset Name: Agricultural Data

### Model Overview:
The Crop Yield Predictor is a linear regression model designed to estimate crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors. It uses features such as soil quality, rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, crop type, and planting density to predict the yield of different crops.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by farmers, agricultural planners, and researchers to optimize crop production and management. It helps in making informed decisions about planting strategies, resource allocation, and predicting harvest outcomes based on historical data.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Linear Regression
- Input Features: ['soil_quality', 'rainfall', 'temperature', 'fertilizer_usage', 'crop_type', 'planting_density']
- Output: Predicted crop yield (tons per hectare)

### Model Performance:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1.5
- RÂ² Score: 0.88

### Limitations:
- The model assumes a linear relationship between input variables and crop yields, which may not account for complex interactions between environmental factors.
- Unpredictable weather events, pest infestations, and other external factors not captured in the dataset can affect yield predictions.
- The model's performance is reliant on the quality and representativeness of the training data.
