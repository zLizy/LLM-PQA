### Model Name: Recipe Recommendation Neural Network

### Dataset Name: Culinary Preferences Data

### Model Overview:
The Recipe Recommendation Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to recommend recipes to users based on their cooking history and ingredient preferences. It leverages a neural network architecture that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to predict user preferences for recipes.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by cooking apps, recipe websites, and meal planning services to enhance user experience by providing personalized recipe recommendations. It helps users discover recipes they are likely to enjoy based on their past cooking habits and ingredient preferences.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Neural Network
- Input Features: User ID, Recipe ID, User cooking history, Recipe metadata (ingredients, cuisine type, cooking time)
- Output: Predicted user preference for a recipe

### Model Performance:
- Precision@K: 0.78
- Recall@K: 0.75

### Limitations:
- The model requires a large amount of user interaction data to provide accurate recommendations.
- It may not perform well with sparse data or new recipes that lack sufficient interaction data.
- The model's effectiveness is influenced by the diversity and representativeness of the training data.
