Model Overview
The Artist Recommendation Model uses a collaborative filtering approach with neural network techniques to recommend artists based on user preferences, utilizing TensorFlow for the neural network architecture.

Intended Use
Aimed at music streaming services, this model enhances user experience by providing personalized artist recommendations, promoting music discovery that aligns with individual tastes.

Technical Details
Algorithm Type: Collaborative Filtering with Neural Networks
Input Features: User and artist identifiers
Output: Probability score of user preference
Architecture: Embedding layers for users and artists, dot product layer for interaction modeling, and a sigmoid output layer.
Training: Optimized using binary cross-entropy loss, with early stopping based on validation loss.
Model Performance
Efficient training on a sampled subset of the Spotify playlists dataset, ensuring broad user-artist interaction coverage.

Limitations
May vary in effectiveness with the diversity of user-artist interactions in training data.
