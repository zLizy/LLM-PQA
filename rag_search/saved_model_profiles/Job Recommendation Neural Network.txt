### Model Name: Job Recommendation Neural Network

### Dataset Name: Online Job Portal Data

### Model Overview:
The Job Recommendation Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to recommend job listings to users based on their job search history and professional profile. It uses a neural network architecture that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to predict user preferences for job listings.

### Intended Use:
This model is intended for use by job search websites, career development apps, and online job platforms to enhance user experience by providing personalized job recommendations. It helps users discover job opportunities they are likely to be interested in based on their past search history and professional profile.

### Technical Details:
- Algorithm Type: Neural Network
- Input Features: User ID, Job ID, User search history, Job metadata (industry, job title, location)
- Output: Predicted user interest in a job listing

### Model Performance:
- Precision@K: 0.75
- Recall@K: 0.70

### Limitations:
- The model requires a substantial amount of user interaction data to generate accurate recommendations.
- Cold start problem: New users or job listings with no interaction data may not receive accurate recommendations initially.
- The model's performance is influenced by the quality and variety of the training data.
